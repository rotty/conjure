* Conjure (R6RS version)

This is yet another attempt at a build tool, akin to make(1), in
Scheme.

Conjure is used as a build tool for the spells[0] and sbank[1], where
it's task is mostly file generation by substition, similiar to what
autoconf-generated "configure" scripts do.

It currently contains the following functionality to fulfill the above
purpose:

** Dependency engine

This is currently using file modifiction times (no MD5 goodness yet)

** An internal DSL

Acts as a "build language", embedded in Scheme. An example from
spells:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(task cc (cc-conf))

(task (configure
       (produce '((("spells" "foreign") "config.sls")
                  <= (("libraries" "foreign") "config.sls.in")))
       (fetchers (cc-fetcher 'cc)
                 (hostinfo-fetcher))))
#+END_SRC

** Configuration module

Allows tailoring files to a specific environment by doing substitions
on template files. An example from spells:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(define c-type-alignof
  (let ((target '("#!@(host-info os)"
                  "#!@(host-info cpu)")))
     ...))
#+END_SRC

In this code fragment, the #!@(...) "forms" are substituted at build
time with the hosts' operating system and CPU.

The configuration module uses a cache, avoiding a potentially costly
re-calculation of substitution value on each source file change.
